### 👨‍💻 About Me :
Greetings! 👋 Born and raised in Brazil, I've been living in Germany for almost a decade 🤯 Now I am emabarking on an exciting journey transitioning from my previous role of Project Coordinator to Web Developer. 🚀 Combining my love for technology and design with my acquired organizational and problem-solving skills, I'm ready to dive into the dynamic world of web development.


### 🌐 Tech Enthusiast & Learner

Currently, I am focused on mastering the fundamentals of web development, specifically HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 🚧 The objective is to use my background in project management to construct user-friendly websites and contribute to the continually evolving digital landscape.


### 🎬 Creative Background

Beyond the code, my creative roots extend into film/video production, graphic design, and photography. 🎨 This diverse skill set allows me to approach projects comprehensively, considering both the technical and aesthetic facets of web development.
