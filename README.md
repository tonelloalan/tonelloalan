### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alan Tonello and I am currently embarking on a journey to transition from project coordinator to web developer, combining my passion for technology and design with my proven organizational and problem-solving skills.

Leveraging my experience in project management, I am actively learning web development fundamentals, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Eager to apply my organizational and creative skills to build user-friendly websites and contribute to the ever-evolving digital landscape.

In addition to my technical skills, I bring a background in film/video production, graphic design, and photography. This diverse skillset allows me to approach projects with a holistic perspective, considering both the technical and aesthetic aspects of web development.
